## Installation

Install NPM package for inquirer, create index.js code to gather information from the npm library along with the generateMarkdown.js file.

## Usage

You must create a github repository. Clone the repo SSH Key to your terminal to create a new repo on vs code. Clone your files and licenses needed as per each project. Download the npm inquirer to your vs. It will create a lock package json file and node nodules folder. You will then create a code in you index.js to pull the data from the file you just downloaded. YOu will create objects with "type", "message", and "name" to display data in the terminal when it's at use. On the generateMarkdown.js file you will create a code used to help populate the data you have placed in the index.js and both files will be used to cross reference information from each other.
